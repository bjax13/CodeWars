// very interesting Kata.  Will have to debug to solve
// There are a series of 10 bombs about to go off! Diffuse them all! Simple, right?

// Note: This is not an ordinary Kata, but more of a series of puzzles. The point is to figure out what you are supposed to do, then how to do it. Instructions are intentionally left vague.
