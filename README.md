that takes in two numbers a and b and returns the last decimal digit of a^b. Note that a and b may be very large!

For example, the last decimal digit of 9^7 is 9, since 9^7 = 4782969. The last decimal digit of (2^200)^(2^300), which has over 10^92 decimal digits, is 6.

The inputs to your function will always be non-negative integers.























<!-- For a given list [x1, x2, x3, ..., xn] compute the last (decimal) digit of x1 ^ (x2 ^ (x3 ^ (... ^ xn))).

E. g.,

lastDigit([3, 4, 2]) === 1
because 3 ^ (4 ^ 2) = 3 ^ 16 = 43046721.

Beware: powers grow incredibly fast. For example, 9 ^ (9 ^ 9) has more than 369 millions of digits. lastDigit has to deal with such numbers efficiently.

Corner cases: we assume that 0 ^ 0 = 1 and that lastDigit of an empty list equals to 1.

This kata generalizes Last digit of a large number; you may find useful to solve it beforehand. -->
